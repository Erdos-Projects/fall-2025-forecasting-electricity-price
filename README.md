Team project: fall-2025-forecasting-electricity-price

Datasets: 
  # energy residential price for KH/monthly is our main target
  https://www.eia.gov/ # We need to find a way to download the data
  # environmental data to be used as predictors
  https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/past-weather-zip-code-data-table # Apparently easy to download

Problem: 
  What are the drivers of energy residential price for KH/monthly 

Stakeholders: 
  state and local governments (useful for regulation on how to work around increase in prices or alternative sources of energy that may not increase according to the predictors) # we probably need to make this a bit more       specific

KPIs: 
  Accuracy # Probably a good idea to ask our advisor in a future meeting
